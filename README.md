## Amazon EventBridge Integration Solution for AWS API Gateway

This Quick Start demonstrates an integration with AWS API Gateway for Amazon EventBridge. This solution enables your Amazon EventBridge event bus to trigger a rule that evaluates events and invokes an AWS API Gateway as a target for matched events. The AWS API Gateway had been configured to deliver events to application hosted on AWS ECS. You can use this as a starter project to extend this solution for any scenario that can use AWS ECS to run code.
